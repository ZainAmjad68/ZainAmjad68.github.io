								<h2>Adolescent CS Adventures</h2>
								<p>During my adolescence, my passion for technology and computers took me on thrilling adventures in the world of computer science. Despite being raised in a non-technical environment, my insatiable curiosity for all things tech-driven defined my path. I distinctly remember sitting in front of a PC at the tender age of 3, trying to understand its workings and gradually gaining the confidence to operate it on my own. By the time I reached 12, I had become the go-to technophile for everyone in my neighborhood block, fearlessly delving into the realm of computing, whether it was coding small scripts to automate mundane tasks or finding ways to crack pirated games. These adventures not only honed my technical prowess but also instilled a sense of accomplishment, pushing me to embrace challenges head-on. </p>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/teeanger_exploring_on_computer.png" alt="" width="225" height="225"/></span>My early exposure to Computing paved the way for an exciting journey into the world of programming and digital exploration. As my peers were busy with typical childhood activities, I was engrossed in discovering the secrets of coding and automation. My evenings were filled with excitement as I dived into coding projects, seeking innovative ways to make daily tasks more efficient. Despite the occasional misadventures and setbacks, my determination never wavered. Unbeknownst to me, these formative years of adolescent CS exploration were laying the foundation for a lifelong passion for technology, shaping a career path that I eagerly pursued as I grew older.</p>
								<h2>Formal CS Education</h2>
								<p>Building on my adolescent CS adventures, my formal CS education became a natural progression for me. Driven by my passion for technology and my early exposure to computing, I made the decision to pursue CS as my major. However, the journey wasn't without its hurdles. Adjusting to the new environment and dealing with health issues posed initial challenges. Nevertheless, I persevered and quickly found my footing, excelling in all the technical subjects. It didn't take long for me to stand out in the class, eventually becoming the topper for the second part of my degree. My thirst for knowledge and passion for pushing boundaries led me to take advanced classes like AI, Pattern Recognition, and Computer Vision, alongside Master's students, as I sought greater challenges beyond what the bachelor's curriculum offered.</p>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/adult.png" alt="" width="240" height="240"/></span>Throughout my formal CS education, I thrived on the pursuit of knowledge and growth in the field. My passion for technology, coupled with the valuable experiences gained during my adolescent adventures, propelled me forward. Despite the initial obstacles, I was determined to make the most of my learning journey. Excelling in technical subjects and pursuing advanced courses brought a sense of fulfillment, validating my choice of major. Wholeheartedly embracing the challenges of my formal CS education, I soon realized that my unwavering passion for technology was not only propelling me to excel academically but also establishing the bedrock for a promising and fulfilling career in the ever-evolving realm of computer science.</p>

								<h2>Life as a CS Professional</h2>
								<p>Transitioning into my life as a CS professional, the path was initially uncertain as I approached my final semester. Graduation loomed, and I pondered which tech stack to specialize in. To explore my options, I took on diverse experiencesâ€”a one-month internship in Unity Game Development, delving into CRMs like Salesforce for a few months, and finally finding my footing in JavaScript while developing a website for a startup. The fulfillment I found in working with JavaScript, coupled with positive experiences using it for projects during my studies, convinced me that this was the path to pursue.</p>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/software_engineer.png" alt="" width="298" height="298"></span>Even before graduating, I was presented with offers from various firms, all vying for me to join their ranks as a JavaScript Software Engineer. After careful consideration, I chose the company that offered the most promising prospects for learning and growth, along with a supportive and positive work culture. Since making that decision, I haven't looked back. My journey as a CS professional has been dynamic and enriching. Within the organization, I have worked extensively with different JavaScript frameworks such as Node and React, along with diverse databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and DynamoDB. The opportunity to explore the serverless paradigm on AWS and create microservices has been truly fulfilling. Furthermore, I've gained exposure to CI/CD pipelines, configuring them for the microservices I developed, utilizing tools such as Travis, Docker, and GitHub Actions. My professional growth has also encompassed a strong emphasis on testing, honing my skills in testing code using Mocha, Chai, MSW, and other testing technologies. I continue to make an impact, now leveraging my expertise to contribute to more mature aspects of the company's endeavors, such as optimizing performance and spearheading the setup of new and innovative projects.</p>
